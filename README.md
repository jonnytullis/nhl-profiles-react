# NHL Profile App
I built this app for the SportRadar front-end exercise.

## Tools
In order to run this app, you must have the following tools installed:
* Node (v16.18.1)
* NPM (8.19.2)

The versions don't necessarily have to match exactly, but that's what I'm currently running on my machine.

## Install Dependencies
Run `npm install`
## Start the App
Run `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
