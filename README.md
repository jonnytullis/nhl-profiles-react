# NHL Profile App
I built this app for the SportRadar front-end exercise (see the provided [document](sportradar-spec.md)). It includes the following features:
* Dashboard to browse NHL teams organized by Conference/Division
* Team profile page (can deep-link)
* Player profile page (can deep-link)
* Client-side search for teams and players

## Pre-requisites
In order to run this app, you must have the following tools installed:
* Node (v16.18.1)
* NPM (8.19.2)

The versions don't necessarily have to match exactly, but that's what I'm currently running on my machine.

## Install Dependencies
Run `npm install`
## Start the App
Run `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
## Automated Tests
Run `npm run test`
